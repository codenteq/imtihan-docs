# Testing

The Imtihan was created with the tests in mind. A file is already installed for your `phpunit.xml` application. The Imtihan comes with convenient helper methods that allow you to test it in a meaningful way.

## The `.env.testing` Environment File
In addition, you may create a `.env.testing` file in the root of your project. This file will be used instead of the `.env` file when running PHPUnit tests or executing Artisan commands with the `--env=testing` option.

## Running Tests
As mentioned previously, once you've written tests, you may run them using `phpunit`:
```sh copy
./vendor/bin/phpunit
```
In addition to the `phpunit` command, you may use the `test` Artisan command to run your tests. The Artisan test runner provides verbose test reports in order to ease development and debugging:
```sh copy
php artisan test
```
### Filter
It is possible to filter instead of running the tests from scratch every time, for this follow the `--filter` command
```sh copy
php artisan test --filter=ExampleTestController
```
It is possible to run a single function inside the filter
```sh copy
php artisan test --filter=ExampleTestController::function_name
```
